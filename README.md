# FinalProjectGeneticCMPUT366
A project that explores the use of Genetic Algorithm to find generalized weights such that A* algorithm is able to solve game The Witness

To run the project

Run analyze.py , make sure you are in the correct folder and you have chosen correct problem files , analyze.py has pre trained weights.

To retrain the model run main.py which will train the weights from beginning.

To test greedy algorithm change import from import genetic_algo as ga to import genetic_algo_greedybfs as ga
